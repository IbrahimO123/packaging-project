    <p id="Depalletizer">
Depalletizer<br>
Depalletizers will operate at high or low level. High level
depalletizers are faster as the cycle time is shorter.
Depalletizing can be for crates, cartons or bulk delivery. For
crates each layer on the pallet is normally clamped by a
head and lifted onto a table from where they are driven
onto a conveyor and orientated with the narrow edge leading in preparation for decrating. The motion can either
be reciprocal between columns or robotic. For bulk delivery
of new bottles, each layer can be clamped using a
pneumatic cushion and lifted onto a conveyor, or more
commonly swept at high level onto a conveyor. Cans are
swept at high level onto a conveyor.
    </p>
    <p id="Unpacker">
        Unpacker<br>
During this operation bottles are removed from crates or
cartons. This can be done using a reciprocal, continuous
(vertical or horizontal) or robotic machine. The heads can
be fitted with clamps or inflatable tulips (so called as they
are tulip-shaped). The tulips fit over the bottles and are
inflated in order that they may be lifted. In some cases
automatic bottle sorters are installed after the unpacker.
    </p>
    <p id="Bottle-Washer">
        Washer/Rinser<br>
Depending on the operation a rinser or washer or, indeed,
a combination of both maybe used. The washer will be
used for returnable bottles and is usually double ended i.e.
bottles enter one end and exit the other end. If a line is for
non-returnable bottles a rinser will be used and it is normal
to install it as a ‘monobloc’ or in combination with the
filler. If both returnable and non-returnable bottles are
used both a rinser and washer maybe installed and then
the appropriate machine is by-passed.
    </p>
    <p id="Filler">
        Filler and Crowner<br>
A mechanical or electro-pneumatic filler could be used. The
sizing will be appropriate to the line size and in cases where
there is no tunnel pasteurizer will be the core machine. If
the filler is filling sterile beer it will probably be enclosed in
a ‘clean room’.
The typical situation for a bottle filler would be beer at 4°C
and 5.5 g/l CO2; this would require a 144 valve filling
machine for filling 275 ml bottles at 60,000 bph.
Fillers are produced in a range of diameters and pitches
between valves as are crowners. The filler above could
have a pitch of 94 mm and the crowner would match this.
A crowner to match this filler would have 24 heads.
Can Fillers and Seamers are also produced in a range of
diameters and pitches between valves.
A typical Filler Seamer combination for filling 330 ml cans
with beer at 4°C and 5.5 g/l CO2 at 90,000 cph would be a
150 valve filler and an 18 head Seamer, both at 90 mm
pitch.
    </p>
    <p id="Pasteuriser">
        Tunnel Pasteuriser<br>
If the product is not sterile (i.e. treated through the use of
sterile filtration or plate pasteurization) a tunnel pasteurizer
will be used to pasteurize the beer in package. Due to the
necessity to keep the pasteurizer full during production for
best utilization of energy, it is often treated as the core
machine on the line.
The high cost of running a tunnel pasteurizer compared
with other forms of sterilization is changing opinion. The
tunnel pasteurizer is regarded as the safest form of
stabilization as it pasteurizes beer in its final package.
However with improved hygiene there is no reason why a
flash pasteurizer or sterile filter cannot be used in its place.
Both capital and revenue savings are significant.

    </p>
    <p id="Labeller">
        Labeller<br>
        The labeller maybe wet glue for paper or self-adhesive for
        pressure sensitive labeling (PSL). Wet glue labellers can run
        at speeds of up to 1200bpm, where as self-adhesive
        labelers may run up to 800bpm. It is possible to have
        combination labellers with wet and self-adhesive labelling
        together. It is also possible to purchase a labeller which
        applies sleeves.
    </p>
    <p id="Packer">
        Packer<br>
        The crating operation is identical to the de-crating
        operation, only in reverse.
    </p>
    <p id="Palletizer">
        Palletizer<br>
The reciprocal and robotic palletisers are similar to the depalletizers. High level palletisers will also operate faster. The issue with high level palletisers is being able to feed them faster enough. As a result, twin lane feeds are often used. The pallet is on a lowerator, and as it receives each Hydraulic lowerators are faster than their mechanical layer, the pallet moves down to receive the next one. equivalent but it means digging a hole in the floor to accept the hydraulic cylinder. Low level palletisers require more mechanical effort in order to lift each layer and sweep it onto the top of the pallet.
